- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
  * We would use class components over function components mainly if we want to deal with lifecycle methods for some reason.
- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
  * `componentDidMount()` runs after the first-render of the component, `componentDidUpdate()` runs everytime the component's props or state changes and `componentWillUnmount()` runs before the component is removed from the DOM.
- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
  * The purpose of a custom hook is to share the same logic between components by returning useful data/functions that would otherwise be repeated throughout every component that needed such logic.
- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?
  * Testing is important because it helps bug prevention, team cooperation and makes us think about edge cases, which helps us develop better and more testable code.
